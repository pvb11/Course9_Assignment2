## Overview{.smaller}

This web page consists of an html format presentation. The presentation is written in R Markdown and contains a plot created with Plotly. This work was done on Monday, December 30, 2019 and is hosted on NeoCities open source servers.

The plot will rely on the 'uspop' data set in R and display the population of USA over time.
